# Object oriented programming in JS

1. Inheritance
   - in js we have prototype chaining not inheritance
2. Encapsulation

- js doesn`t have access modifiers, everything is public
- if you need private property use module or module reveal design pattern (IFFE + closure)

3.  Polimorfism

- can achieve by super() or dunder **proto** property after invoking function from object

## SOLID

- important to know, because this is core rules how to modeling OOP abstraction

## Additional rules:

1. use getters and setters for building object API
2. use underscore before name convention to say that something is private
3. if you need more functionality in classes use Typescript, it`s awesome superset for JS
4. one class one file
5. you can combine functional and OOP paradigm
